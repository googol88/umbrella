    Post-It Note Murals for Social Activists
  </p>
</p>

## About the Project
Umbrella is a platform for social activists to spread messages in a Post-It note style virtual Lennon Wall. Features draggable sticky notes and options to create messages with text or drawings.

### The Stack
- [React app](https://github.com/facebook/react) with [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui)
- Node.js/Express server
- [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database)
- Statically deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

> ðŸš¨ At the moment, there is no functional back-end due to issues integrating with Firebase DB. Use the `static` branch to run without the Node server.
## Setup

Because this app is made of two npm projects, there are two places to run `npm` commands:

1. **Node API server** at the root `./`
1. **React UI** in `react-ui/` directory.

### Run the API server

In a terminal:

```bash
# Initial setup
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

#### Install new npm packages for Node

```bash
npm install package-name --save
```


### Run the React UI

The React app is configured to proxy backend requests to the local Node server. (See [`"proxy"` config](react-ui/package.json))

In a separate terminal from the API server, start the UI:

```bash
# Always change directory, first
cd react-ui/

# Initial setup
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

#### Install new npm packages for React UI

```bash
# Always change directory, first
cd react-ui/

npm install package-name --save
```
